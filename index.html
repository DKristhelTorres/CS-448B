                <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 4.5vw; margin-right: 4.5vw;">
                Over the course of history, life expectancy has seen dramatic transformations, reflecting the complex interplay of socio-economic progress, public health advancements, and systemic challenges across nations. While some nations have experienced substantial improvements in longevity, others face stagnation or decline, highlighting persistent disparities. Our research delves into these global disparities in central death rates to uncover the complex influences of development indicators and energy metrics.
                <br><br>
Life expectancy, measured by central death rates, is intricately linked to factors such as economic development, healthcare access, energy production, and consumption patterns. By analyzing the interplay between these metrics, we aim to unravel the extent to which development indicators—such as GDP, population dynamics, and energy intensity—shape mortality trends. This comprehensive evaluation aims to shed light on the nuanced relationship between energy systems and human well-being, offering insights into targeted strategies for reducing inequalities and enhancing global health outcomes.

                To better highlight these trends over time, we offer a dual-map visualization with accessible manipulation of variable global development indicators to contrast with central death rates. In respect to functionality, these two independent but interconnected maps are meant to display for the years 1980 to 2019, the following : </p><br>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 4.5vw; margin-right: 4.5vw;">
                        <li>The left map represents central death rates as a heat map, using a gradient to signify variation in mortality rates across countries for a selected year.
                        </li>
                        <li>The right map provides an interactive platform for users to overlay development indicators — such as GDP, population, energy consumption, and energy production— on a global scale. User’s can toggle between these indicators to observe trends and potential correlations between these indicators and central death rate.
                        </li>
                    </ul> <br>

                <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 4.5vw; margin-right: 4.5vw;">
                The comparative framework of this visualization captures the complex relationship between energy systems, development metrics, and health outcomes. While this remains an overview of our topic of interest, we are able to pinpoint that countries with greater sustainability – reflected in higher energy consumption and production — and higher GDP demonstrate a stronger capacity to reduce central death rates. Reinforcing the notion that a nation’s level of development is closely tied to improvement in human well–being; better life expectancy.
